# Before the noise

First show using the more powerful laptop, so I can throw more in.

Coded an "option" thing that shifts pre-time dilation by default, to allow 
swapping between related ideas on the fly according to a pulse whose speed and 
balance I can steer.

# After the noise

The blurred-out calm stuff worked pretty well for the more ambient-y stuff of 
Sleep Now Forever.

I need a better method for smoothly controlling values... like a midi 
controller.

I also need to write a smoothstep variant of `stroke()` that has a parameter for how 
much to blur the edges.
