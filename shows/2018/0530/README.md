# Notes

Problems getting the pulseaudio driver to hook up correctly, so no amplitude 
for this show. That sucks.

So, since I didn't have `u_amp`, I tried to make it more calm and less jittery than usual,
accentuating the expansive parts of Tara's music. I think it went well considering I didn't
prepare any new techniques in advance.

Ka Baird brought her own projection stuff, so I just hit play on that.

I didn't end up using the prepared `blitz.frag` that I copied from last show's 
Drug Spider experiments.
