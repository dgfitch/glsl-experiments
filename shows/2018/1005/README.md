# Prep

New mirror madness, confirming amplitude in works...

Trying to keep a central "theme" of fractal mirrors, but evolve it for each 
band.

# Show

I used one of the prepared "setups" for each band here, and then mutated as 
each went. Not quite as controlled as I would like, but I didn't change/tweak quite as often as I have in the past and still got interesting color shifts.

The beat uniform as a really slow LFO wave (halving it by hitting L a bunch) is very useful. I think I want a way to have multiple LFOs like that, then I can do interesting additive/subtractive stuff with them.
