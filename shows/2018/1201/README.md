# Prep

Did some voronoi distance-point stuff to generate some interesting concentric 
circle patterns as the base for this one.

Had to actually display code, so a bit of time went into a decent setup 
for that. Prepared a clear terminal setting to display over the glsl.

Got tmux to clear out with:

  :set -g status

Got vim to have no status highlight with some new stuff in `init.vim`,
currently bound to shift-H in normal mode.

NOTE TO SELF: Remember to toggle cursorline as needed with `[oc`

# Show

Went pretty damn well, I think. Algorave was a ton of fun!
