# Before the noise

Did less pre-production work before this one; a quieter, more introspective kind of psychedelic show.

Worked mostly on quick vim macros to toggle marked/commented lines and quickly save different buffers to glslViewer's file.

# After the noise

I failed to record And Illusion's set and ran out of space in my phone for Pat Keen, but captured some.

Spencer specifically asked for darker - less whites, I need to make quick 
shortcuts I can drop on to tint things, and fast ways to tweak those.

Most useful were my new macros in setup.vim for toggling commented areas at 
global marks or near comments like // AMP. That worked even better than I 
thought, although I need to include imap equivalents and get function key
fast shortcuts.

Prepped revelation.frag but didn't end up using that; mostly add-libbed 
stuff based on plain/between and threw in a little bit of the more psychedelic 
plasmaforks from prior work.
