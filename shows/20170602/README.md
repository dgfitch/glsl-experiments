Did little pre-production work before this one; a quieter, more introspective kind of psychedelic show.

Worked mostly on quick vim macros to toggle marked/commented lines and quickly save different buffers to glslViewer's file.


I failed to record And Illusion's set and ran out of space in my phone for Pat Keen, but captured some.

Spencer specifically asked for darker - less whites.
