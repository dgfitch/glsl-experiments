# Before the noise

Worked mostly on doing some interesting shape-centered stuff using inspiration from the 
PixelSpirit tarot deck.

Before the show, had plenty of time to prep.

* silence.frag is the between-sets piece.
* colors.frag is the base for Judders.
* thrown.frag is the base for Cut Shutters.
* blork.frag is the base for And Illusions.

# After the noise

Went pretty well, getting better at responding to the music.

Tried to get more "shapey" for Cut Shutters, which worked in some places and 
less in others.
